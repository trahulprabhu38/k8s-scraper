        You are tasked with exploring the university website provided and extracting the following details.
        The website URL is: {website_url}
        1) Identify and list all programs available at the university, such as AIML, etc.
           Also, list the top 3 programs offered by the university based on relevance or ranking.
        2) Get the location of the university: city, state, and country.
        3) Identify the degree levels available at the university: Bachelors, Masters, PhD.
        4) Check for the mode of study options: Full-time, Part-time, Online.
        5) Fetch the QS World University Ranking for the university, if available.
        6) Determine the university's acceptance rate.
        7) Identify if the institution is public or private.
        8) Look for information on campus facilities such as Library, Labs, Sports facilities, etc.
        9) Find the total number of students currently enrolled at the university.
        10) Identify how many students are residential and how many are non-residential.
        11) Write a short description (about) of the university, including details like exams required and available scholarships.
        12) Gather the university's admission requirements, including exams, documents, and other prerequisites.
        13) Investigate the available scholarships: merit-based, need-based, or any other types.
        14) Extract cost-related information for both domestic and international students, including:
            i) Cost for domestic students.
            ii) Cost for international students.
            iii) On-campus accommodation cost and off-campus accommodation cost.
        15) Find out the tuition fee structure: per year and per semester.
        16) Identify the application fee.
        17) Extract housing fee information if available.
        18) Calculate the average living expenses per month for students.
        19) Estimate the total cost of attendance for a year, including tuition and living expenses.
        20) Collect student experience details such as reviews or comments.
        21) Look for highlights of campus life, including extracurricular activities, student groups, etc.
        22) Determine the university size: small (<10k students), medium (10kâ€“30k students), or large (>30k students).
        The website URL you will be exploring will be passed as an argument. You should dynamically fetch the details from the site and structure the response accordingly.
